# AtmoTrack

AtmoTrack is an AI-powered nutrition and symptom tracking prototype designed for individuals using GLP-1 medications. The app explores how combining patient-reported symptoms, dosing patterns, and motility data (simulated for this prototype) with AI can provide actionable guidance for patients and structured insights for clinicians. AtmoTrack demonstrates how digital health tools can support daily self-care while providing meaningful context for treatment adherence and GI symptom management.

## Key Features

**Symptom Log:**  
Track appetite, energy, bloating/gas, cramps, nausea, and bowel movements using simple 1–5 or mild/moderate/severe scales.  

**Motility Insights:**  
View dummy gastric emptying and transit time data with visual graphs and AI-generated summaries.  

**Adaptive Meal Planning:**  
AI-generated 2-day meal plans tailored to user symptoms and motility patterns, including meal breakdowns and grocery lists.  

**Dosing Tracker:**  
Log GLP-1 RA medication brand, dosage, and timing to correlate with symptom patterns.  

**Chat Assistant:**  
Ask AtmoTrack about symptom management, nutrition guidance, or interpreting your data.

## How This Project Uses AI (Plain Language)

AtmoTrack uses AI to help patients make sense of their day-to-day experiences on GLP-1 medications:

- **Meal Guidance:** Generates personalized meal plans based on your logged symptoms, energy, appetite, and simulated motility data.  
- **Symptom Interpretation:** Summarizes patterns in your symptoms and suggests practical ways to manage GI discomfort.  
- **Data Translation:** Converts raw symptom and motility inputs into understandable, actionable advice for users.

The AI runs within **Google Gemini (AI Studio)**, using carefully designed prompts to ensure outputs remain educational and supportive—not medical advice.

## How It Works

1. The user logs symptoms and medication dosage.  
2. AI analyzes symptom trends and simulated motility data.  
3. Tailored meal plans are generated to support nutrition while minimizing discomfort.  
4. Historical entries are saved and accessible under each section’s “History” view.

## Developer Notes

- This is a prototype built for educational and research purposes.  
- All symptom and motility data are dummy placeholders.  
- Future updates may integrate real device outputs and refined AI feedback loops.
